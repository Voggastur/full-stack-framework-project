## 1. UX <a name="UX"></a>


I decided to build an e-commerce store for Lidya, who is the sister of my wife and quite handy making various apparel.
I have mixed in some of her real content with bags, shirts and shoes found on the web.

The admin will have the ability to manipulate store items, via CRUD functionality.

There is also a FAQ messageboard for interaction with users, the admin can delete questions he doesn't like and answer the one he likes.
A Contact page is also present for sending PM with email functionality via emailJS.
Emails sent via the Contact page are sent to the admin email.

Product Reviews are available, and authenticated users can write reviews, limited to one review per product and user, however every product can handle several reviews.

User authentication checks happen frequently across the page so creating a User Profile is mandatory for most interactions except for browsing.

When testing payment I always used the VISA option:
Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242

Expiry date shall be in the future, although I never used a year more than 5 years into the future.
CV2 can be any 3 numbers and the postcode I always matched with my delivery adress postcode, but I don't think there are any checks from the Stripe side.

#### II. Wireframes: <a name="UX2"></a>


* [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

* [Database Schema](wireframes/db_schema.pdf)


Attached are 2 pdf files one for the database schema made in excel and one with several handdrawn pages of webpage layouts for different parts of the page.

The wireframes stage is were I am usually stuck for days, every initial design seems lacklustre and lacking in style or functionality.
After testing a few paths into what was actually possible within my scope of ability I had an easier time drawing up schemes for the different pages.

The initial name for the project was Salomos Apparel. Salomo is a biblical figure of great reverence in Ethiopia as he is the alleged 
ancestor of the royal family in Ethiopia through his love-child with the equally revered Queen of Sheba.

However as I talked with Lidya the person I am doing this for, she already had a logotype and name of her brand - Africa Hab,  
so I use that instead from that point. This explains the project name salomo, and some references to salomos apparel in settings.py, for example the AWS S3 Bucket.

After realizing the design process was taking a lot of time I believe that frontend design is not my specialty, even though it is fun.
However as I step into the midproject development I find myself really enjoying watching backend code come to fruition and work as intended.

I found it helpful to simply list the projects different django apps functionality and relation inbetween, to get an overview in the magnitude of complexity - one of the wireframe pages reflects this process.

The database wireframe is implemented generally as planned aside from different fieldnames, and reviews are moved into the products app.

#### III. Development Process: <a name="UX3"></a>


For this project I used the Boutique Ado project we did in the last stage of Code Institute as groundwork and I added the models;
Review, Question and Answer.

Userprofiles now have an image to show next to their reviews, a default user image was taken from google to prefill this field on user registration.

I foregone the FAQ accordion implementation for complexity issues and the answers show directly upon viewing the page.
The number of questions listed is not expected to be immense, but in that case an accordion could help save window space, I might implement it in the future

Answers on the FAQ page must be posted by an authenticated admin, but questions can be posted by any logged in user.
This means that posted questions will initially have a small muted paragraph below saying it's waiting for an answer until admin interaction.
An Add Answer button is visible only for the authenticated superuser.

My initial plan was to have a landing site for presentation and products in the same app, then I changed my mind and separated the home app from the products, 
as the case is for the foundation app Boutique Ado. Because I was concerned with increasing complexity.

Near the end of my development I created two users to test my features, Rick and Morty, with two images from the rick and morty tv series. Both Rick and Morty have left 2 reviews each.
Both Rick and Morty have put up questions on the faq page, which the site administrator account also have put up answers to.

### IIII. Business Goals: <a name="UX4"></a>

The business goals of Africa Hab are:

I. To sell authentic homemade bags and dresses.  
II. To encourage Lidyas work in something she enjoys doing.


<a href="#TableContents">Back to Table of Contents</a>
<hr>


## 2. Features <a name="Features"></a>


I. The FAQ app is a messageboard where the admin can interact with the users by answering questions posted by users.
Preferably the admin can post some questions of his own to which many users have requested an answer

II. User authentication is handled with django-allauth by handling login and signup,
additionally userprofiles are autocreated upon user registration.

III. A review model was created for the product app for showing in detailed product view,
and the questions and answers models are in the FAQ app for use in faq.html.
Questions can be posted by any authenticated user, and will be publicly posted, answers must be posted by admin.

IV. An authenticated user can add a review for any product, and he can edit or delete the review after posting it

V. The Boutique Ado project that I made in the previous Code institute module is the groundwork of this page,
some apps that came along have made the transition with little to no changes, such as the bag app and the checkout page,
which only needed some adaptation for links and changes to match other changes in the userprofile, which have some fields different from the boutique ado project.

VI. A Contact Page with emailJS backend is implemented for contact with admin directly for different concerns.

VII. A technically simple About page was added to provide some background on the people behind the page.

VIII. Separated navigation buttons for product categories have been made into 4 large buttons below the fixed navbar,
some advanced styling was made for the purpose, otherwise the four categories would have been a simple dropdown menu in the navbar.

IX. A general Shop button was added to navbar to provide for a non-contextual browsing of all mixed products,
this feels a little superfluous with so few products in the store at this point, and after all the work I put into the styled category buttons, but I decided to keep it.

X. An admin button link was added to the navbar that shows only if logged in as superuser.
I implemented this after I learned the trick {% url 'admin:index' %} which will link to the admin index subpath.

XI. I searched for good matching fonts on google, and found Merriweather and Montserrat, which looks nice for my purpose.
However I came to like Montserrat so much that I used it everywhere and decided to drop out Merriweather in the end.

XII. Colors used in this web project are white #ffffff, a very dark blue #212529 for backgrounds, and a gold color #d1a000.
For my buttons categories I had slight contrast issues so I settled with 'burlywood' #deb887 for overlying text and the gold #d1a000 
for a hover effect on a button and a box-shadow.

XIII. The Africa Hab Logo was made in [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) and I use it in the left side of the navbar. It acts as a 'Home' button.

XIIII. The Africa Hab Icon was made in [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) by cutting the continent from the logo and converting it with a free online converter

## 3. Features for the future <a name="Features2"></a>


I would like to implement rating for all the products, perhaps it could be as part of leaving a review.

I would like to implement user authentication with social media such as facebook for easier authentication.

## 5. Testing <a name="Testing"></a>


* Manual testing was done throughout development of this project.
* For testing user authenticated actions I created 2 profiles, in addition to the admin superuser, called Rick and Morty.


I would log in with Rick, and leave a short product review on bag number 3,  
I would be redirected to see the result directly and that the review has been added under the Reviews section below the detailed product section.

Afterwards I would go to the FAQ page and try to leave a question, which in its final version updates the FAQ with a new question.

I would then log out my user, and log in as admin to answer the previously posted question by user Rick.  
I would be redirected to see the answer added directly under the related question.
Then I would log out admin.

To test more than one question by different users I log in with Morty and add a new question and would be able to see that it adds on top of the previous question written by Rick.

I would then, still logged in as Morty, visit the same bag that Rick submitted a previous review on, and add my own review as Morty.
After submitting it I would be redirected to see that the bag now has 2 reviews on top of each other, one made by Rick and one made by Morty.

As an authenticated user with id Morty, I would only be able to see two edit/delete buttons below my own review, but not on Ricks review.
To test edit I would click to edit on my own review (as Morty), and add an extra ! at the end, and click submit.

The review will update accordingly and now show an extra ! at the end.
After this I would try the delete button, and after clicking it I would be redirected to the viewed bag with only one review remaining written by Rick.

Then, still logged in as Morty, I would visit the FAQ page and see my question similarly to reviews has an edit and delete button below my own question, but not Ricks question.
I would proceed to test edit and delete in the same manner as I tested the review.
I would then log out as Morty and log in as admin.

I would visit the FAQ page and see Mortys unanswered question below Ricks answered question.
I would instead of clicking answer, click the delete button to remove it.
I would be redirected to the FAQ page with only Ricks question remaining.

### I. Validators: <a name="Testing1"></a>


I have not written automated tests for this project, however I have done a few validation checks on different parts of the project


* I used W3C Markup validator to try and validate HTML as I finished development.
However many errors show due to the nature of django templates, so reading the printout is difficult

* I used W3C jigsaw CSS Validator to validate CSS.
Many warnings show for prefixes added with the Autoprefixer, but since they are needed for browser interoperability, I ignore those.

* I used JSHint to validate the Javascript.

* I used PEP8 to help with indendation and make sure the Python files are PEP8 compliant.

## 6. Deployment <a name="Deployment"></a>


To deploy this project I had to create an account on Heroku
Then I created a Heroku app called salomos_apparel
In the Resources tab I commissioned Heroku postgres for use as database
In the settings tab I clicked reveal config vars and entered the following variables from each respective source:

* DJANGO_SECRET_KEY "XXX"
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "XXX"
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "XXX"
* AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME "AWS Bucket name"
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY "XXX"
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY "XXX"
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET	"XXX"
* EMAIL_HOST_PASS "password generated by Gmail for connecting third party service"
* EMAIL_HOST_USER	"the connected email"
* USE_AWS "True"

A requirements.txt file was created to let Heroku know the python dependencies needed to run the project
Typed the following in git bash terminal
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

Then I created a Procfile and entered the following in it
web: gunicorn salomo.wsgi:application

Prepare models for migrations by typing
python3 manage.py makemigrations

Create tables in database by typing
python3 manage.py migrate

Then I went to the deploy tab in heroku and connected to my github repository,  
then I selected enable automatic deploys in the automatic deployment section, and made sure master branch was selected.

And then for the final time in the git bash terminal I typed
git push
which pushed the code to heroku thanks to the above automated deploy setting in heroku.

In the bottom of the build view on heroku, the link for the deployed website can be found,  
I clicked the link and could see the deployed website on heroku.

Deployment finished.

### I. How to run this project locally <a name="Deployment1"></a>


You will need to create a free account on AWS and set up an S3 bucket

You will need to create a free account on Stripe

Download the project from the github repository

Install required python dependencies by typing in the git bash terminal:
- pip3 -r requirements.txt

Then type python3 manage.py runserver

Create a file named .gitignore, and enter the following line into that file:
env.py
Save and Close .gitignore

Then create file env.py and enter the following lines:
os.environ["DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"] = "XXX"
os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = "XXX"
os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = "XXX"
os.environ["AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME"] = "XXX"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "XXX"
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "XXX"
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "XXX"
Save and Close env.py

The "XXX" values above represents secret keys that needs to be extracted from your AWS and Stripe accounts,  
and the Django secret key can be generated here: [Django Key Generator](#https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/),  
unless you use the secret_key variable in settings.py generated upon the Django install procedure.

Create superuser account for accessing database:
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Type in a valid email, then type in username followed by the password two times,  
the password should be at least 8 characters long, but can be overruled by forcing through a shorter password by clicking "y" on the followup question in the terminal,  
creating it this way with a short password will only work in the git bash terminal and not by users signing up on the webpage.

Type the following to prepare migrations according to the models
python3 manage.py makemigrations

Then type the following to create the tables in the database according to previously prepared migrations
python3 manage.py migrate

The app can now be run locally.

## 7. Credits <a name="Credits"></a>


* The basis for this project is the Boutique Ado project by Chris Zielinski at Code Institute, but with my own customizations and expanded features.
* The Bag and Checkout apps are used as is from the Boutique Ado project except for a few renamed variables.

* The Profiles app is largely similar as well, except for a new image field in userprofile, and relevant image field mentions in the forms and views.

* The Products app has its foundation in Boutique Ado as well, in particular the products.html template, although with some new css.
The Product and Category models, the all_products view, the widgets.py and custom_clearable_file_input template used for image file inputs were also imported.
Although the widget is now also in use for the Profiles.userprofile model and form view.
The Product model was shortened with less fields than the original to make it more comprehensible in the beginning of my development.
The Products product_detail view had to be modified to also show reviews, but from there on all the code is handmade, although a lot of repeating patterns could be used.

* Corey Schafer on Youtube have good video tutorials for Django beginners that helped me write the faq app and relevant models.
Youtube in general is a good source of educating material related to Django, although most of them like to suddenly spice up the projects with difficult concepts.
This makes it difficult to absorb the knowledge and I could only gain a bit here and there.
That's why I want to credit Corey Schafer here, he didn't unnecessararily complicate his beginner tutorials, and I achieved a treshold of understanding.

* The Category buttons css is separated because they were found on this codepen https://codepen.io/yancy/pen/gBLLxz and then modified and augmented with my own styles.

* The Stripe [webpage](https://www.stripe.com/) was checked frequently to understand and test webhooks, and set up a new endpoint.

* Slack was a frequent source of help when troubleshooting, and valuable insights were gained from discussions with other students on Code Institute.
