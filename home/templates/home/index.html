				<p class="front-p text-center">This is a new startup website made to showcase homemade bags, dresses and
					jewelry with african flair.
					Everything has been handmade by Lidya a native of Ethiopia who's been designing dresses, bags and accessories since 2010.
                    The website doesn't have too much fancy flare to it yet, but it makes a showcase of her products!</p>
